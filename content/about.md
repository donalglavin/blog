I'm currently working as a Senior Mechanical Engineer on a Copper and Gold mine in Queensland, Australia. 
Although my formal education is in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics I've always had a passion for Software Development and Programming. 

This blog aimst to provide a portfolio of projects I've worked on in the hope of sparking innovation and/or helping people with projects of their own. 

My main areas of interest are: 

- **Finance** both with Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis (namely though statistics and machine learning). 
- **Numerical Modelling**, namely: Computation Fluid Dynamics, Discrete Element Method's and Finite Element Analysis.
- **Data Analysis and Analytics** primarily focused on finance and realestate.

As well as writing little scripts that make my life just that bit easier. 

You are welcome to copy and use anything you see on this site however please keep in mind I provide no warrenty and take no responsibility for what it is used for or if it breaks something.
