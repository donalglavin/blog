title: Managing Obsidian Vaults (Work, Personal and a Blog) with Git.

# Introduction. 
Obsidian is a fantastic tool for creating and managing what some people call a *second brain* but more simply put a collection of notes and information that is sometimes forgotten. 

My main objective to use Obsidian is quite complex and requires multiple vaults with the main goals (just to name a few) including:
1. Fast tracking the creation of reports and documentation with Markdown, Pandoc and Latex for work.
2. Tracking team performance, their projects, and key commitments throughout the year (also work related). 
3. Planning my life, 5 year goals, journaling and putting ideas on paper, so to speak for both work and personal. 
4. Generating a portfolio/website where I can share my knowledge and learnings with others and give back to the open source communities.

Where this get's tricky is coordinating these things in their respective "shears" to ensure I'm respecting my work life boundaries, spending the limited time I have doing what I should be in the right space (i.e. not spending work time planning holidays, and not completing work tasks at home). I think the separation is important to stop burnout and ensure quality of life and in this post I hope to communicate how I do it **systematically**

# Rules of Engagement. 
The following rules outline the goals/Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the system. They should be able to be looked back on and used as a marking criteria to ensure I'm staying true to my word and holding myself accountable. 
1. No work notes should be included in my personal vault. 
2. No personal notes should be included in my work vault. 
3. Each vault (bar the blog vault) should consist of it's own 5 year plan (the work one for Career planning and the personal one for Life planning).
4. The only time a work related note should exist outside of the work vault is if it pertains to a blog post (with the express permission of my supervisors and the company). *These are more so work related passion projects, or accomplishments that are worthy of making a note in a Portfolio.*

(more rules to come)

# The System. 
In order to implement this system the following tools are required:
1. Obsidian.
2. Git. (and a github account). 
3. Hugo (for creating the blog).

Useful but not required.
- Scoop (the windows user level package manager). 
- Neovim (an alternative to obsidian with VimWiki/Obsidian.nvim)
